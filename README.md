# Dashboarding

A shell and tutorial for dashboard of maternal depression prenatal and postpartum screening. Real data not shown. 
One of the main asks of this project was to incorporate a flexible and user friendly way to compare sites, which is why there are three options. This was created with reference to another dashboard, originally in Tableau, to make it more easy to share with outside users.
